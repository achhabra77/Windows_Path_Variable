# Windows_Path_Variable
Path variables enable users to access and run executables irrespective of their current working directory in command line.  In example, the notepad application can be opened via command line from the user's home directory ecen though the executable resides in C:\Windows\System32.  This is enabled though the C:\Windows\System32 directory being populated to the path variable. Additionally, programs/executables made available though the path variable may also be accessed through the Windows run box (invoked through the Windows key and "r" key sequence).

This document provides a description of the path variable and how to configure it.
